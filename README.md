Also, be sure to put GTA in borderless window mode, or windowed mode, since the overlay doesn't work in fullscreen.

It was rewritten in C# using WPF for v2.0!

It also includes a customizable Speedometer with two different modes (Speedometer and Tachometer(a.k.a. "RPMmeter")).
Thanks to Shirabrixx82 for the original concept and the major part of the offsets utilized and also Gopinath001 for the incredible Pattern Scanner!
